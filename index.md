## About Me

Hello! My name is Deyuan Yang, and I go by Doreen. I'm a rising Junior at DePauw University, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I plan to graduate in 2024. My email address is: deyuanyang_2024@depauw.edu. 

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Victoria Interrante. She is a Professor in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Professor Interrante's research focuses on applying insights from visual perception and cognition to the development of more effective virtual reality experiences and the more effective communication of complex information through visual imagery. In this work, she has enjoyed collaborating with colleagues in a wide variety of fields, from architectural design and neuropsychology to engineering and medicine. Here is a link to [her website] (https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~interran/) 


## About My Project

The topic of my project is "Continuous subjective cybersickness assessment"
Objectives: The current gold standard metric for cybersickness assessment is subjective reporting. The two most commonly used instruments are the Kennedy-Lane SSQ (administered after an immersive experience) and the FMS (fast motion sickeness) scale, administered at repeated discrete intervals during an immersive experience, such as every 2 minutes. We seek to learn patterns of data associated with impending cybersickness, to be able to predict cybersickness onset before it occurs. These efforts would be facilitated if we had access to continuous data about cybersickness outcomes along with continuous data about the visual stimulus (e.g. 3D optical flow, considering contrast and brightness) and the userâ€™s head/eye behaviors (e.g. instantaneous 6DOF head pose, eye gaze, and gradients thereof) as well as various physiological measures.
