## A Small Introduction of this week

Hard to imagine that half of my summer research in UMN past and the time goes too fast. I really enjoy the time that I stay in the lab and work on the UE project. This week, the Phd student help me a lot and we finish the environment set up of the research!!! The next week, we can start to make the experiment instruction and run people in the experiment. But before that I have to get my IRB approval. 

## Some tasks I finished

This week, with the huge help of the Phd student, we finish the environment wet up and plan to run the research. I should take the test and get my IRB next week.
