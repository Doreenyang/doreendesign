## A Small Introduction of this week

This week of research is a busy week and as we planned last week, I start to prepare for the test of IRB. I've already submitted my application of it and wait for the result. At the same time, Professor suggest me help another Phd student and he's in Florida now. He uses Unity to set up a roller coaster scene and want to test cybersickness too. I need help him generate the image each frame when the project runns. It's so hard for me to do that because I haven't learned Unity before. I find many videos online to learn some fundamental knowledge of Unity and try to figure that out myself.

## Some tasks I finished

This week, I finished the IRB learning and application. Hopefully, I can get the approval by next week. Also, I start to learn Unity as well to help the other students with his project using my free time.
