## A Small Introduction of this week

This is my second week to do the research with Professor Interrante and her Phd students. I'm so happy to work with them and learn a lot of things about Unreal Engine. After choosing the research topic of cybersickness, I start to contact the Phd students in the lab who is in charge of the research, and know more information about it. At the same time, I learned much more things about Unreal Engine. 


## Some tasks I finished

During the second week of the research, I continue to learn the Unreal Engine, but the original research of this topic use Unreal Engine 4 to build the scene, so I switch my learning to UE4. Also, I contact the Phd student in this research to know more information about the research and prepare to help him.
