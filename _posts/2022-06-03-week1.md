## A Small Introduction

This is my first week to come to the University of Minnesota to do research. After travelling to Las Vegas, I fly to Minneapolis and start my DREU research with Professor Victoria Interrante. She is really nice and asks her PHD students to help me set up the lab. I'm so excited about his research opportunity and look forward to work with them.

## Topics of Research

Generally, our research topics are all about Virtual Reality. Professr Interrante gave me a sheet and asked me to choose the topics I want to explore. I selected the "Continuous subjective cybersickness assessment." Actually, this is about the investigation of cybersickness. This one is really interesting and attractive, and I hope I could learn many things from this research!


## Some tasks I finished

During the first week of the research, I learned the Unreal Engine 5. I already learned some basic uses of it and can make a small game. I'll continue to learn more and use the tool well in order to conduct the research well. I 'll work hard on it!
