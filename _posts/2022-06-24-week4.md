## A Small Introduction of this week

This is my forth week to do the summer research. Thanks for DREU to give me this opportunuty. Time goes so fast, and now is the forth week. I start to use my knowledge of UE4 and to build the scene with the Phd students for the research. It's really hard for me, because I'm only the beginner of the UE4 learner, and there are many things I need figure out myself. However, it's a good opportunity for me to learn and study. 

## Some tasks I finished

During this week, I finish the fundamental learning of the UE4 and try to start set up the environment for the research.
