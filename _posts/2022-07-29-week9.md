## A Small Introduction of this week

After I got the first data of the first participant, Professor and the Phd student discuss with me and they beleive it is better to improve the enviroment of the project and also use a high-quality graphics. So, they plan to stop running the participants and improve the process of experiment. This week, my task is to make a small test of three tools, knob, slider, and button to check the participant the accuracy and time to find the right number.

## Some tasks I finished

This week, I make a small test of the three tools to check the acceesibility of them. Also, I model a 3D printing for the next part of the experiment, which is a passive experiment. In this environment, the scene will jump automatacally and we should use a chin rest to fix the position of head of the participants. So, I use 3D printing technique to make one.
