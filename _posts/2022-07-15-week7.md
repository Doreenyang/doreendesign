## A Small Introduction of this week

I still wait for my IRB approval this week and Professor says it's a long time to wait for the IRB approval. Also, for the Unity project, I can't figure out myself and I ask for help from other Phd students. One of the students is really nice and help me figure out the general thought of this type of problem and lead me to do it little by little. Although the process is really really hard, I get the series of images successfully!


## Some tasks I finished

I finish the image generation of the Unity project and also I talked with Professor about my next step of research.
