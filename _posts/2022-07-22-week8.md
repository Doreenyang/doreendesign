## A Small Introduction of this week

I got my IRB approval this week!!! So excited! At the beginning of this week, I spend much time practicing the process of running the experiment. Then, I start to run the first participant. The process is so hard and many unexpected things happen when I run it. Luckily, I figure out them well and get my first data of the experiment. 

## Some tasks I finished

I got the IRB approval and start to run the first participant for the experiment.
