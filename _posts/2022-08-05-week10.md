## A Small Introduction of this week

This is my last week for the summer research. Time goes too fast and I really don't want to leave here. I love the people here and the working environment. If I have chance to come there again, I'll definitely come. This week it the final week, and it's the wrap up my current work and I talked to the Phd student what he need to do next and what I'm doing now. Also, I do the data analysis of the person I tested and try to use the data to figure out which tool is better.


## Some tasks I finished

I finish most work of the research project and finish the small test of the three tools, the 3D printing, and the data analysis of the experiment result.
